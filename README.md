# Free ChatGPT API
Access ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) API for absolutely free, hosted from your own computer! No API key required. A modified instance of PawanOsman/ChatGPT in different coding languages.

This repository contains different folders for different programming languages:

* javascript
* python

Inside each folder, you'll find the respective files. The `app.[extension]` file is the main file to run, and the `example.[extension]` file demonstrates how to interact with your self-hosted API. It's that easy!
